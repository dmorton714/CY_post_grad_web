# Project 1.1: Enhanced Personal Finance Tracker

Expand on your Project 1 finance tracker by adding new features for data visualization, filtering, sorting, and improved usability â€” all while continuing to use browser `localStorage`.

This project reinforces intermediate front-end development skills and introduces working with third-party libraries like Chart.js.

---

## Project Goals

- Enhance your basic finance tracker from Project 1
- Work with **external libraries** (Chart.js)
- Practice advanced **array operations** (sorting, filtering, pagination)
- Build a more **interactive and professional UI**
- Reinforce **modular, scalable code practices**

## Features to Implement

### 1. **Add Date to Each Transaction**
- Update the form to include a date input.
- Save the date along with the transaction.
- If left blank, default to today's date.

```js
{
  id: 1,
  description: "Groceries",
  amount: -30.00,
  date: "2025-08-07"
}
```


### 2. **Display Transactions with Sorting and Pagination**
- Show transactions in a table or list.
- Allow users to:
  - Sort by amount, date, or description
  - Choose ascending/descending order
- Add pagination:
  - Display only 5â€“10 transactions at a time
  - Add Previous/Next buttons to move through pages


### 3. **Filter Transactions by Date Range**
- Allow users to input a **start date** and **end date**
- Filter the displayed transactions accordingly
- Update totals to reflect filtered transactions only


### 4. **Visualize Data with Chart.js**
Use the Chart.js library (via CDN) to create:

- A **pie or doughnut chart** showing income vs. expenses
- A **bar chart** showing total expense per category (if added)

Resources:
- [Chart.js Docs](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/)
- Use static chart options first, then update dynamically with user data


### 5. **Responsive & Polished UI**
- Use Flexbox and/or CSS Grid
- At least one media query for responsive layout
- Add subtle animations or UI transitions (optional)
- Different colors or styles for income/expense entries


### 6. **(Optional) Simulated Login**
- Prompt user to enter a username on load
- Store and retrieve data in localStorage per user (e.g. `financeData_john`)
- Show a welcome message or allow switching users
